If you think you'd be interested in being my boyfriend, please ping me at ✉️ typeofemale.ingroup.social@gmail.com. I'm 📏 161 cm tall and ⚖️ 49 kg-ish. 

I have [two tickets to this guitar concert on the 14th of February](https://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202502141930) -- the perfect date! 🎸 🌹

Essentially -- I'm looking for a partner who I can have interesting conversations with , someone who can complement my shortcomings and tolerate my autism. 🤗

I'm EA, rat-adjacent -- interests range from 🎹 piano manufacturing, 🍳 cooking to 💻 formal methods! In my spare time I do fun things, like meeting famous people ❪eg. Roko Mijic etc.❫ and contributing to discourse. 💭

I have been told it's a good idea to add two truths and one lie. If you figure out which one is a lie send me an email... 🤔

1. 🥬 Sugar snaps are my favourite vegetable.                        
2. 🎮 I scored over 30000 points on Word Mole (the Blackberry game).
3. 🏃‍♀️ I've never won any ❪physical❫ sporting event.
