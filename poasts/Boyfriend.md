If you think you'd be interested in being my boyfriend, please ping me at typeofemale.ingroup.social@gmail.com.

I have [two tickets to this guitar concert on the 14th of February](https://www.wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/202502141930) -- the perfect date!

Essentially -- I'm looking for a partner who I can have interesting conversations with :), someone who can complement my shortcomings and tolerate my autism.

I'm EA, rat-adjacent -- interests range from piano manufacturing, cooking to formal methods! In my spare time I do fun things, like meeting famous people (eg. Roko Mjilic etc.) and contributing to discourse.
