If you think you'd be interested in being my boyfriend, please ping me at typeofemale.ingroup.social@gmail.com. I'm 161 cm tall and 49 kg-ish. 📏

I have two tickets to this guitar concert on the 14th of February -- the perfect date! 🎸 🎵

Essentially -- I'm looking for a partner who I can have interesting conversations with :), someone who can complement my shortcomings and tolerate my autism. 🤗

I'm EA, rat-adjacent -- interests range from piano manufacturing 🎹, cooking 👩‍🍳 to formal methods! In my spare time I do fun things, like meeting famous people (eg. Roko Mijic etc.) and contributing to discourse. 💭

I have been told it's a good idea to add two truths and one lie. If you figure out which one is a lie send me an email... 🤔

1. Sugar snaps are my favourite vegetable. 🥬
2. I scored over 30000 points on Word Mole (the Blackberry game). 📱
3. I've never won any (physical) sporting event. 🏃‍♀️
