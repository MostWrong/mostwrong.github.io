Bluesky is great. Honesty, it harks back to an older version of Twitter - much cleaner. The ingroup has already settled there.

I'm releasing a simple jupyter notebook to faciliate crossposting messages, this is very much a work in progress - here is the link.

Now you can crosspoast your bangers as both tweets and skoots, making sure the ingroup on both platforms never misses out on your poasting!!!

I've added support for image posting on atprototools and URL cards too !!! Elmo limited the twitter API though so no cross posting :(

Revisiting this post months later is hilarious -- god bluesky fell off so hard lmfao.
